# Unofficial public issue tracker for Complice

*This repository is not in any way affiliated with or officially
sanctioned by Complice.*

It exists only as an emphatically non-hostile issue tracker 
for the https://complice.co service, because I find it a useful
way to fill [the gaps left by Complice not providing an official
public issue tracker](https://github.com/aspiers/complice/issues/2),
in just the same way that https://github.com/isaacs/github
is extremely useful for effective collaboration with other GitHub
users on issues with GitHub.

If Complice start providing a decently functional public issue tracker
at any stage, I will be delighted to move all issues from here to that.
